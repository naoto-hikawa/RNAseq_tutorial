# RNA sequence tutorial

### This tutorial is perfect if:

* you are just starting bioinformatics and you want to learn how to install necessary softwares
* you want to replicate someone else's data in-house
* you are currently paying to convert fastq into read count files but you want to do it for free
* you have many samples you want to analyze and you want to do it fast & automatically

We will use *Drosophila melanogaster* as the model organism. The modules are in these sequences:

#### 1. Basic installation guide
#### 2. Learn how to convert 1 fastq into 1 read count file
#### 3. Learn how to convert multiple fastq into 1 read count file
#### 4. Learn how to conduct simple downstream analysis

This tutorial was motivated by my own experience of struggling to build an RNA-seq pipeline, and is not intended to be the "correct" solution to everything. Also, my preferred language of coding is Java, so if you find any mistakes in Python, R, or bash scripts I provided, please let me know!
